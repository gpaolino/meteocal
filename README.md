#meteocal

Within the context of Software Engineering 2 course (Politecnico di Milano, academic year 2014/2015) our goal was to develop a Web Application using Java EE platform, in particular using EJB as business logic.

MeteoCal wants to offer a new weather based online calendar for helping people scheduling their personal events avoiding bad weather conditions in case of outdoor activities.
